Basic operations
----------------

These are things performed to samples 

Miniprep:
Cell(bacteria,DNA) -> DNA

Zymoprep:
Cell(yeast,DNA) -> DNA

Quikchange:
Plasmid -> Plasmid, modified

Gibson Assembly:
Plasmid -> Plasmid, modified

PCR:
DNA -> DNA, increased concentration

Digest:
DNA,circular or linear -> DNA,linear 

Transformation:
DNA -> Cell(bacteria,DNA)

Electroporation:
DNA -> Cell(yeast,DNA)

Transfection:
DNA -> Cell(unknown,DNA)

Gel Electrophoresis ->
DNA,soluble -> DNA,increased purity 

RNA Extraction:
Cell(RNA) -> RNA

RT-PCR:
RNA -> DNA

Split cells:
Cells -> Cells, decreased density
